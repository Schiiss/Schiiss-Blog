Over the course of the 3 years I have been in industry, I have developed a strong focus on automation and security in the cloud. I enjoy seeking out inefficiencies, improving upon them and ensuring it is done in a secure manner. I have worked with clients that have had complex cloud environments used to collect and analyze large amounts of data which often contained PCI and PII. This means security is at the forefront of everything I do. 

It is very easy for someone to create cloud services with all the default configurations. This is where I take pride in not only automating the creation and scaling of these services, but also ensuring they are configured optimally from a security perspective. This comes with staying up to date with the latest cloud technology advancements and security best practices so I can ensure my clients are always on the cutting edge.  

I hope my passion for tech reflects in the blogs I write and in sharing some of the challenges I faced while learning or implementing a new technology, someone (Like You!) can learn from those mistakes.
